Gender Equality Actions in Research Institutions to traNsform Gender ROLES (__GEARING-Roles__) is a strong multidisciplinary consortium of 10 European academic and non-academic partners that will design, implement, and evaluate 6 Gender Equality Plans (GEPs) following the steps described in the GEAR tool (define, plan, act and check) with the firm objective of challenging and transforming gender roles and identities linked to professional careers, and work towards real institutional change.
