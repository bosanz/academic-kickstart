abstract: "The usage of mobile phones has increased in our lives because they offer nearly the same functionality as a personal computer. Specifically, Android is one of the most widespread mobile operating systems. Indeed, its app store is one of the most visited and the number of applications available for this platform has also increased. However, as it happens with any popular service, it is prone to misuse, and the number of malware samples has increased dramatically in the last months. Thus, we propose a new method based on anomaly detection that extracts the strings contained in application files in order to detect malware."
