 abstract = {Children have been increasingly becoming active users of the Internet and, although any segment of the population is susceptible to falling victim to the existing risks, they in particular are one of the most vulnerable. Thus, some of the major scourges of this cybersociety are paedophile behaviours on the Internet, child pornography or sexual exploitation of children. In light of this background, Negobot is a conversational agent posing as a child, in chats, social networks and other channels suﬀering from paedophile behaviour. As a conversational agent, Negobot, has a strong technical base of Natural Language Processing and information retrieval, as well as Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, the most innovative proposal of Negobot is to consider the conversation itself as a game, applying game theory. In this context, Negobot proposes, ﬁrst, a competitive game in which the system identiﬁes the best strategies for achieving its goal, to obtain information that leads us to infer if the subject involved in a conversation with the agent has paedophile tendencies, while our actions do not bring the alleged oﬀender to leave the conversation due to a suspicious behaviour of the agent.},
